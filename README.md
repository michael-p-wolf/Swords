# Sword-Manager

This is a project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, CS 25100 at Purdue University

I have implemented a Min-Heap represented in an array at Sword Manager/src/CommonUtils/MinHeap.java

I have implemented a Hash Table in an array at Sword Manager/src/CommonUtils/BetterHashTable.java

I have implemented a Priority Queue with a circular array at Sword Manager/src/CommonUtils/Interfaces/BetterQueue.java

These data structures are used together to create the clean sword manager at Sword Manager/src/Drones/BetterCleanSwordManager.java

This is intended to be used in an imaginary video game we are developing in class.
There are unique swords in the game that are used by players, returned to us to be cleaned, and then handed back out
We are to keep track of each sword, when they are requested, and fulfill those requests.

There are test modules and files includes in the Sword Manager/test directory to test the Hash Table, Priority Queue, and Sword Cleaner
